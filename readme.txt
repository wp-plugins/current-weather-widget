Sidebar widget that displays the current weather for a given city.

== Description ==

A simple sidebar widget that displays the current weather for a user-defined city. Powered by the [http://openweathermap.org/API](OpenWeatherMap API).

The design has been deliberately kept simple. It should match the default text of any theme, but can easily be customized by any web developer.

It was built and tested on 3.5.x, but will probably work on earlier versions of WordPress.
